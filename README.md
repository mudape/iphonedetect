# iPhone Detect
This integration sends a message to the defined hosts on UDP port 5353.  
The iPhone responds, _even when in deep sleep_, and an entry in the ARP cache is made .  

Uses Home Assistant's [device_tracker](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker/) and idea/script from [return01](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/return01)

Only **IP addresses** will work, _no hostnames_!  
You have to assign a **static** IP address(es) to your iPhones, probably in your router. 

_The interval_seconds time must be shorter than the timeout in which the ARP cache is cleared (usally 15-45sec), or the phone will be marked not_home._
_So, leave it at the default value (12sec) or make it shorter._

## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: iphonedetect
    consider_home: 60
    scan_interval: 12
    new_device_defaults:
      track_new_devices: true
    hosts:
      hostname1: 192.168.0.17
      hostname2: 192.168.0.24
```
This will create `device_tracker.hostname1` and `device_tracker.hostname2` once the devices have been detected on your network.  
(Re)start the Wi-Fi on your device/phone to trigger their creation on first run. 

__Note__  
If you have `track_new_devices: false` (in this or any integrations specified before this) for the device_tracker component you need to manually change `track:` to true for each device in `known_devices.yaml`  
(see component settings for [device_tracker](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker/#configuring-a-device_tracker-platform))  
```yaml
hostname1:
  icon:
  mac:
  name: hostname1
  picture:
  track: true
```
